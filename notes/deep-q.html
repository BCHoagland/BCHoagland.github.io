        Q-learning is a very effective method for small environments where we can store Q-values for each state individually. But what if we're working
        in much more complicated environments? If the state space is large enough, we'd have to fill in so many values in our Q-table that the algorithm
        loses its practicality. The solution to this for generalized complex environments? We'll get to it. The solution to this for complex environments
        specifically with discrete action spaces? Deep Q-networks.
        </p>

        <p>
        The idea behind the Deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm is to represent the Q-function with a function approximator instead of a table. We'll
        introduce some error into our Q-values by doing this, but this will speed up our learning. If we're using a neural network as our function
        approximator, then \(Q([1, 2, 3], 5)\) and \(Q([1, 2, 4], 5)\), for example, will have similar outputs from the get go. This makes sense,
        since similar states will probably have similar Q-values. If we were using a Q-table, though, we would have had to fill in both Q-values
        independently of each other. From here on out, I'll refer to the neural network that approximates our Q-function as a Q-network.
        </p>

        <p>
        Let's assume we have a way to make our Q-network produce accurate Q-values. If we have this, then we can do exactly what we do in normal
        Q-learning: pick the action that gives us the largest Q-value. If we're in an environment with 5 possible actions, we can run each action
        through our neural network along with the current state and see which one gives us the largest value, then take that action.
        </p>

        <p>
        This is all well and good, but the question of how to fit this Q-network still remains. We need a solid way of determining
        Q-value targets for our neural network to produce so that we can run some form of regression and get more accurate Q-value predictions in the
        future. There are multiple ways to get these targets, but an efficient way is to use the Bellman Equation for \(Q\)
        \[
        \begin{align*}
        Q(s,a) &= \mathbb{E}_{s'}[r(s,a) + \gamma\mathbb{E}_{a'}[Q(s',a')]] \\
        &= \mathbb{E}_{s'}[r(s,a) + \gamma\max_{a'} Q(s',a')]
        \end{align*}
        \]
        How did I get to the second expression? Since we'll always pick whichever action maximizes the ouput from our Q-network, we don't need the
        expectation over \(a'\). Our action choice will be deterministic, and the expectation of a deterministic number is just that number. This
        expression will be what gets us our targets for our Q-network. We'll define a target as
        \[
        y = r(s,a) + \gamma\max_{a'} Q(s',a')
        \]
        If we run our agent in an environment and get lots of \((s, a, r, s')\) samples, then we can plug these values into our target definition and
        gets lots of datapoints with which to run regression on our Q-network. This is the basic idea behind DQN, but this by itself won't be enough
        to have stable training. Instability in training comes from several issues with how we fit our Q-network.
        </p>

        <p>
        Firstly, notice that the Q-function itself
        is used in the definition of the target, which introduces bias. Additionally, regression assumes that the data points being used have
        no correlation with each other. Since our data is gathered sequentially, though, the transitions we save will have strong correlation.
        </p>

        <p>
        We'll solve (mostly) the bias problem by using target networks. Instead of using \( Q \) in our target definition, we'll use
        an older \( \bar{Q} \). We'll create this copy of our network at the beginning of training. Every time
        we update \( Q \), we'll also update \( \bar{Q} \), but only very slightly in the direction of the new \( Q \). This ensures that our regression
        targets don't move around too much. We'll use Polyak averaging to do this in practice.
        </p>

        <p>
        To address the correlation in our training data, we'll introduce replay buffers. As we observe transtitions in the environment, we'll throw
        them into a big collection of previous transitions that we've seen. When we perform regression, we'll sample from this collection. In practice,
        we'll set a limit on how big the replay buffer can get, and then delete the oldest transition once the max capacity has been reached. Adding
        these tricks to the Q-network fitting gives us the DQN algorithm. Just like with normal Q-learning, it uses ε-greedy action selection to ensure
        that the agent explores the state space

        The breakthrough paper from DeepMind on DQN in 2015 showed RL researchers that using deep neural networks as Q-function approximators, although
        theoretically unsound, could actually be tuned to work very well. The RL community realized that there was room for serious improvement, though.
        For discrete action spaces, DQN worked well enough. For continuous action spaces, though, DQN has a gaping flaw. Its Q-function targets are
        defined
        \[
        y = r(s,a) + \gamma\max_{a'} Q(s',a')
        \]
        For small, discrete action spaces, checking Q-values for each
        action isn't hard to do at all. For continuous action spaces, though, we would have to test infinite actions to find the max Q.
        This obviously isn't possible, so we'll need another way.
        </p>

        <p>
        The idea of the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) is to learn a Q-function, use this to learn an explicit deterministic policy, and
        then use this policy to tell us what action to use when calculating our Q-function targets. This probably seems cyclical and confusing, but
        it should become clear as we work through the derivation. To start, we'll examine our definition of the Bellman Equation for \(Q\)
        \[
        Q(s,a) = \mathbb{E}_{s'}[r(s,a) + \gamma\mathbb{E}_{a'}[Q(s',a')]]
        \]
        This equation is pretty clunky because of the inner expectation over actions, so we'll use a deterministic policy \( \mu \) to select actions.
        Just like with the DQN targets, using a deterministic policy means that we don't need an expectation
        \[
        Q^\mu(s,a) = \mathbb{E}_{s'}[r(s,a) + \gamma Q^\mu(s', \mu(s'))]
        \]
        This new expression is only variable with respect to the next state of the environment, so we can estimate it by just sampling tons of transitions
        from the environment and plugging them into this expression.
        </p>

        <p>
        So far, all we've done is transform our Q definition by using our policy. We did the same thing with DQN, except now we're using a generalized
        policy \(\mu\), which could be represented by a neural network or anything that's deterministic, really. To make our Q-function compatible
        with continuous action spaces, we'll need to parameterize it somehow and use function approximation to get from state-action pairs to values.
        We can do this pretty easily (if we have enough samples from the environment) by fitting a neural network to the Q definition we just made
        using regression. We'll parameterize this Q-network with \( \phi \)
        \[
        \begin{align*}
        y &= r(s,a) + \gamma Q(s', \mu(s')) \\
        L(\phi) &= \mathbb{E}[(Q(s,a) - y)^2] \\
        \phi &\gets \arg\min_{\phi} L(\phi)
        \end{align*}
        \]
        </p>

        <p>
        Now that we have a Q-function approximation, we can use it to update \(\mu\) to give us actions that produce
        larger Q-values. We'll assume that \(\mu\) is parameterized by \(\theta\). We want to maximize \( Q(s,a) \), so we'll just take
        its gradient w.r.t. \(\theta\) and follow that. \(Q(s,a)\) has to be differentiable w.r.t. \(a\) for this to work,
        but since we're assuming a continuous action space we can say that's true. In the literature, this gradient is written out using the chain rule
        so that you can see explicitly that part of the gradient is w.r.t. action. This can make it look strange and complex, but conceptually we're
        just running plain old gradient ascent
        \[
        \theta \gets \arg\max_\theta \mathbb{E}_{s\sim p}[Q(s,\mu(s))]
        \]
        </p>

        <p>
        We have a way of approximating Q and we have a way of using that approximation to improve our policy, but this setup will end up being very
        unstable for the same reasons as with DQN. Thus we'll use target networks for \(Q\) and \(\mu\) in our Q-target definition and a replay buffer
        here, too. Instead of ε-greedy action selection, we'll simply add some random noise to the actions our policy gives us during training. With
        these tricks, we can form the DDPG algorithm

        DDPG can perform well, but it can be very brittle with respect to its hyperparameters for a number of reasons. All these problems stem from
        more estimation errors in our Q-network, and there are a number of tricks that we can use to mitigate these issues. Our end goal is to make
        it much harder for our policy to exploit errors in our Q-value estimates and force these estimates to be more precise in the first place.
        </p>

        <p>
        A common problem with Q-learning algorithms is the neural network overestimating Q-values. If this becomes severe enough, the policy may
        think one action is very good when in reality it is only mediocre and another action would be optimal. It's pretty clear why this is bad.
        A common way of significantly reducing this overestimation is the use of two separate Q-networks. We can initialize two different networks at
        the beginning of training and use the minimum of the two when determining the Q-value targets.
        </p>

        <p>
        Another simple way of making our Q-value estimates better is to update our Q-functions multiple times before updating our policy and target
        networks. Even just updating our Q-functions twice per iteration instead of once can have positive results on training.
        </p>

        <p>
        To help prevent our policy from exploiting errors in our Q-functions (i.e. taking suboptimal actions because the Q-functions are inaccurate),
        we can add a bit of noise when computing the Q-value targets. Specifically, we'll add some clipped noise to the target actions so that the
        Q-values change more smoothly w.r.t. action.
        </p>

        TD3 has a lot going on, but it tends to be much more stable than the original DDPG. There are just a few small notes left to go over. Firstly,
        both DDPG and TD3 train faster if you allow the agent to explore randomly for a bit before training and prepopulate the replay buffer with the
        transitions it observes. This kickstarts exploration and gives the agent a better unerstanding of the state space when it's first starting out.
        </p>

        <p>
        Another important note has to do with adding noise to the actions that the agent takes. After adding the random noise, you should clip the
        resulting action to make sure it's actually a valid action in the environment. I left this second clipping function out of the algorithms
        to reduce clutter, but it could
        potentially cause simulators to throw errors if you don't handle it yourself.
