        <p>
        Brownian motion is a model used to describe the random motion of particles due to their almost constant collisions with other particles.
        It's a simple idea that can be expressed in relatively simple terms, and our intuitions about how particles move can be used to help us form
        a connection between the miniscule, chaotic world of Brownian particles and the simple random walks of introductory probability classes.
        </p>

        <p>
        So what intuitions can we build off of when defining this model? The first may be the observation that the displacement of a particle over any
        given span of time should be independent of its displacement over any other disjoint span of time. The motion is supposed to be random, after all.
        The second may be that the path the particle takes is continuous because it is always in motion (though since our particle could at any time
        completely switch directions, we also expect this continuous path to not be differentiable). The third, and most import, intuition, may be
        that we expect the position of our particle to be normally distributed. Since the motion is random, we expect the mean of this distribution to
        be 0, and the variance of the distribution is most likely related to the amount of time the particle has been moving.
        </p>

        <p>
        Armed with these intuitions, we can naturally define a model of Brownian motion that mathematicians call Wiener processes. Such processes,
        denoted by the infinite set \( \{ W_t \}_{t\geq 0} \) have
        4 main characteristics:
        <br/>
        1. \( W_0 = 0 \)
        <br/>
        2. Disjoint increments are independent
        <br/>
        3. Increments are distributed normally: \( W_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, t) \). This can be generalized a bit to \( W_{n+t} - W_n \sim \mathcal{N}(0, t) \)
        <br/>
        4. \( W_t \) is continuous as you vary \( t \)
        </p>

        <div class="subheader">Derivation from Random Walk</div>

        <p>
        These are pretty general characteristics and apply to a wide range of stochastic processes, but they can be derived from a simple random walk on the
        real number line. Let's say we have a particle that takes a random jump either left or right on the reals (this'll be for 1D motion, but it's easily
        generalizable to higher dimensions) by a distance \( \delta \) every second. We'll denote this random process \( Z_k \), where \( k \) stands for
        the current timestep. From here we can define a random variable to denote the final position of our particle, which we'll call \( X_n \)
        \[
        X_n = \sum_{k=1}^n Z_k
        \]
        The question now is if we can define \( \delta \) in such a way that we can recover in the limit a continuous process like above.
        By the Central Limit Theorem, as \(n\to\infty\), \(X_n\) approaches the Gaussian distribution
        \( \mathcal{N} \Big( \mathcal{E}[X_n], \text{Var}(X_n) \Big) \). Since we know our distribution should end up as
        \( \mathcal{N} (0, t) \), we can calculate these values to see what our \( \delta \) needs to be
        \[
        \begin{align*}
        \mathbb{E}[X_n] &= \mathbb{E} \Big[ \sum_{k=1}^n Z_k \Big] \\
        &= \sum_{k=1}^n \mathbb{E}[Z_k] \\
        &= \sum_{k=1}^n (\frac{\delta}{2} - \frac{\delta}{2}) \\
        &= 0
        \end{align*}
        \]
        From this we can see that \(\delta\) won't have an effect on the mean, so we don't have to worry about that. Now for the variance
        \[
        \begin{align*}
        \text{Var}(X_n) &= \sum_{k=1}^n \text{Var}(Z_k) & \text{since all } Z_k \text{ are i.i.d.} \\
        &= \sum_{k=1}^n \big( \mathbb{E}[Z_k^2] - \mathbb{E}[Z_k]^2 \big) \\
        &= n \; \mathbb{E}[Z_1^2] & \text{since } \mathbb{E}[Z_k] = 0 \text{ and all } Z_k \text{ are identical} \\
        &= n \; ( \frac{\delta^2}{2} + \frac{\delta^2}{2} ) \\
        &= n \delta^2
        \end{align*}
        \]
        Since we want \(n\delta^2\) to be equal to \(t\), we can use some basic algebra to see that
        \[
        \delta = \sqrt{\frac{t}{n}}
        \]

        Such a definition makes intuitive sense. If we increase the total distance we travel but \(n\) stays the same,
        we should also increase \( \delta \).
        As \( n \to \infty \), it also makes sense to make
        \( \delta \) smaller so that we can actually converge to a final distribution (how fast we decrease \(\delta\) w.r.t. \(n\) is another question,
        though). Since we want our final distribution to be \( \mathcal{N}(0, t) \),
        we know that the distance we travel is going to be roughly proportional to \( \sqrt{t} \) (the standard deviation). From all this,
        we can hypothesize that \( \delta \) should be of the form
        \[
        \delta = \frac{\sqrt{t}}{f(n)}
        \]
        where \(f\) is some function of \(n\) that we don't know yet. The above math, though, shows us that \(f(n) = \sqrt{n}\) gives us the result
        we want.
        </p>

        <p>
        We can easily just define \(W_0 = 0\), and it can also be shown that the other two conditions hold.
        Thus we can view Brownian motion as just the limit of a random walk as the number of steps we take approaches \(\infty\) and our step
        size approaches 0 in a specific way.
