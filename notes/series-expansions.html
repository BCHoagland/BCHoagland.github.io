        If we wish to approximate an arbitrarily complex function but still be able to take accurate gradients, it's important that we can prove that
        our approximations have the same gradients as the original function. This way, we can use our approximation, which will be easier to calculate,
        and still have accurate gradients to pass to whichever optimization algorithm we're using.
        </p>

        <p>
        This goal of ours fits very well with Taylor and Maclaurin series expansions. These use derivatives to progressively make a local approxmation of
        a function more globally accurate. The Maclaurin series is simpler, as it begins its local approximation around \(x=0\).

        The simplest local approximation to an arbitrary differentiable function \(f(x)\) we could define would be \(L(x) = f(0)\). It's clear to see how
        this is centered around \(x=0\). To expand this approximation's accuracy, we'll also make the first derivative of the approximation equal the first
        derivative of the actual function at \(x=0\). We can do this with the following expression
        \[
        L(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x
        \]
        Notice how \(L'(x) = f'(0)\), which is exactly what we want. Now we'll make the second derivatives of our approxmation and original function equal
        as well with
        \[
        L(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x + \frac{1}{2}f''(0)x^2
        \]
        If adding the \(\frac{1}{2}\) and the \(x^2\) isn't intuitive, look at what happens when we differentiate our approximation now
        \[
        \begin{align*}
        L(x) &= f(0) + f'(0)x + \frac{1}{2}f''(0)x^2 \\
        L'(x) &= f'(0) + f''(0)x \\
        L''(x) &= f''(0)
        \end{align*}
        \]
        And if we evaluate them at \(x=0\) we get
        \[
        \begin{align*}
        L(x) &= f(0) \\
        L'(x) &= f'(0) \\
        L''(x) &= f''(0)
        \end{align*}
        \]
        This is exactly what we want, and we'll keep adding in higher-order derivatives in the same manner to make our approximation more accurate. If
        we add an infinite number of derivatives to our approximation like this, we'll end up with an approximation that equals our function at every point
        \[
        f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!} x^n
        \]
        </p>

        <p>
        This approximation works well enough, but it'll take some time for it to become accurate for regions that are far away from \(x=0\). Since we can't
        actually compute infinite derivatives in real life, if we want our approximation to be accurate around a certain point for sure, we'll center
        our series of derivatives around that point. This generalization is what gives us the Taylor series
        \[
        f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} (x-a)^n
        \]
        where \(a\) is the point around which our approximation is centered. Another limitation of operating in the real world is that we'll only be able to
        make \(n\)th-order Taylor approximations instead of creating an infinite sum.
